"I was really excited about this soap bar. It arrived and the smell was fantastic and the quality seemed high. That night I had tried the bar out for about a minute working it into my face. The bar was very hard with sharp corners and not the most user friendly. Withing a minute it began burning my face and left me with a chemical like burn for a few days. It dried my face out after just one use and left me in pain for the next few days. With high expectations I was saddened to have this occur. Although, the company itself has a great ""feel good"" mission with eco friendly packaging and a genuine attempt to deliver products that are good for your body.

I have sensitive skin and nails so the bristles are all perfect, not too firm or soft. The larger bristle side has really helped with softening the skin around my nails and decreasing my cuticle growth; perfect for at home manis/pedis, and the other side that has the one line of bristles is perfect for cleaning any dirt/residue out from under your nails.

"The best thing about these phones is the Bluetooth stays solidly connected to my Apple Watch. Unlike some other earbuds I‚Äôve tried, these don‚Äôt skip at all. I‚Äôve had no issues with the battery life... I‚Äôve never had them run out while I‚Äôm using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It‚Äôs slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don‚Äôt fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It‚Äôs angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.",en

"Do not read the old reviews that rave this product. The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.",en

It will need some boosting before I can drain it. The assembly is relatively ease. The product works good but the delivery is poor (zero star). When I received this unit, I noticed there was only 1 strap on the unit and it was kind of loose. When I try to move the box, the bottom of the box fell off.

Where the tires run this blade doesn't pull up the grass well enough to cut it at same height as where the tire doesn't run, whether the grass is wet or dry.

I did think it was well made looking and honestly look no different than the one I had received when I purchased my phone. It's now February and it's already broken. I was very disappointed that it lasted a mere months. I will say this time around I purchased one from my cellular service provider and it was four times more expensive but came with a year warranty. So if these are only lasting on average 3 months based off my experience then you might as well just go purchase the one for your phone from your cellular service company. It is a fast charger, and charge my phone as quickly as the original one. I was just bummed out at how it didn't last very long.",en
These labels look great and are very handy to label ammo boxes to stay organized. The ones I placed on top of ammo cases (on smooth surfaces) have stuck fairly well.

"I received a gift of a himalayan salt lamp last year and have been enjoying its benefits so I decided to buy more to put around the house. I initially bought 2 from this seller due to high ratings and rave reviews. The first 2 arrived and they were beautiful, just the perfect brightness and glow, they were both very different shapes and glow and I loved the fact that it is dimmable, perfect when you want it to be not too bright when sleeping. I ordered another 2 the next day but this time one of them came a bit short of the quality I was expecting. I am aware no 2 lamps are alike and there will be irregularities in the form but this one had gray dark streaks that looked like mold around it and the light was concentrated only on the base of the lamp and the top third half just looked like a pink salt block, I am returning one of them. I guess 3 out of 4 is not bad, hence the 4 stars. Update: As soon as my review posted on Amazon Levoit contacted me directly, refunded my money and told me I didn‚Äôt need to go through the hassle of sending the defective salt lamp, truly impressive customer service. Due to this, I have bought 4 more lamps to give as gifts and all of those arrived in perfect condition and are all excellent lamps.",en

Ms. Samuels Young never disappoints. I recieved an email about the e-release for this book. I immediately downloaded it as I make it a point to read all of her books. I read the first page of this book and was immediately hooked. I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN FOUR HOURS. This is one of her by far best writes. She pushes to a new extreme of erotic suspense and has done an amazingly great job at it. The sex scenes are steamy and the order of events are not your typical guess what happens next. You will not be disappointed. I would love a part II to this book... Keep them coming Pamela!,en

"If you are supposed to squirt this in your toilet bowl and let it sit for ""however"" many minutes, it is a huge disappointment. It is so thick that it will run down but not spread, and you must use a brush to spread it. That incorporates water from the toilet bowl itself and undoes the idea of letting it sit on the surface. I much prefer sprays that actually will cover all the area in the toilet bowl, under the rim, etc. I will not buy this again.",en

"I would not recommend this product. The mug was discolored (had a brown ring and spots) after one use and was handwashed like the directions stated to do. I bought this set as a birthday gift for my husband after reading all of the reviews carefully. He loves Moscow mules and he loves to entertain, so this was a perfect gift! My husband loved them as soon as he saw them...until he used one mug once. My husband has one Moscow mule mug that he has used and handwashed for years and there has never been an issue with it discoloring. I just thought these with their hammered look would be better. Being that I do not want to poison my husband or guests in the future, we will not be using them again. Unfortunately since I am just past the return date, I can not return them but I definitely would not buy these again! Very disappointed after the good reviews.",en

They work fine for my screw guns. They do not work with reciprocating saw or circular saw.

"Fast-paced yarn kept me reading. You could feel the heat, the exhaustion, the sting of knives and bullets, the terror of the unknown in the darkness. Loved the premise, although how a company bought land and got government permits to set up drilling operations practically overnight really stretched credibility. Without giving anything away, some of the story was too predictable. (Gee, why is all that platinum buried three miles down?) I also would have preferred if the story had been told from the perspective of one character, whether hero or anti-hero, but that never really happened. Even the author could not seem to decide if he liked or hated certain key characters. The most heroic had only minor supporting roles and some of them did not fare well. Biggest disappointment was the Hollywood movie ending. How many times have we all seen that ending before? Very convenient way to tidily wrap things up.",en
"I like this Wall Clock as the color is stylish and interesting and it is indeed non-tickling one so it is very quiet. For a noise-sensitive person like me, I can sleep well at night while the clock keeps working on the wall in my master bedroom. The only drawback for this clock I experienced was it was pretty hard for me to install a new AA battery in the back of it at the beginning, but it was not a major issue though. I hope the battery can last long enough to compensate the non-tickling technology that is the main feature of this wall clock. I suggest that the manufacturer smoothen the battery place in the back of the clock so that customers can install a new AA battery easily.",en

"Do not buy these, spend a little more money and buy QD swivels from reputable companies like Magpul, BCM, Midwest Industries etc. One swivel works fine and the other one is full of problems. The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to.

"This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.",en

It does set the TV sleep timer though when viewing via Apple TV so I have to turn the TV back on an hour into streaming. Stilling working on trying to find the software setting to fix this. I use my iPhone as the remote for the Harmony so I have to look at the display in order to get the correct ‚Äúbutton‚Äù so I have gone back to using the cable remote to control the cable as I can do so by feel instead of by sight. Occasionally, the app loses volume control via the iPhone physical volume controls, but leaving and returning to the app corrects the issue.",en

"I‚Äôm so happy I finally bought this stroller!!! It‚Äôs so much smoother and lighter than my BOB single stroller. It‚Äôs perfect, I highly recommend it for running. It folds up easy and takes up less room than my BOB as well. If you are looking for a stroller to go shopping ( in and out of doors ) this is not for you as it‚Äôs too big to fit through normal doorways you the tiniest bit. If you, like me just wanted a stroller to pop in the trunk to go for a run this is the one for you.",en
I bought this labeler because a different brand that I had would not print labels that stuck to cables very well. This one seems to stick a little bit better but it wastes a lot of label material as others have pointed out.

We keep this out in the living room and just keep a few diapers in it instead of having a whole box laying around. I like how it has 3 individual dividers in it where we keep diapers in one wipes in another and keep the diaper rash cream in the final smaller spot.

It's very well made and the stitching seems to be phenomenal. It's definitely worth having,en
